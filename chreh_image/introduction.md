# Chreh's RPiOS Image

On January 10th 2023, chreh (an active member on the KIPR developer discord) published a image of modern RPiOS Desktop with the newest version of all the KIPR software installed on it. This includes:

 - Qt6 version of BotUI
 - refactored libwallaby (libkipr)
 - harrogate
 - any dependencies (libkar, pcompiler)

## Installation

You can download chreh's image from this drive link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/18gXBm63qkNM-x8Gv5KHnpxVoRj3bXq41/view?usp=share_link

Once you have the file, unzip it to retrieve the image (it is quite large). Then you can install that image using Raspberry Pi Imager or another tool just like any other Raspberry Pi OS image. The only difference is that it has the KIPR software preinstalled.
